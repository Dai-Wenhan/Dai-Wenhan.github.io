## Algebraic Geometry for the Generals

**Instruction Watch**: This page mainly covers the algebro-geometric necessary to pass the graduate's general qualifying examinations at [Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn) (and possibly other universities and institutes say). Whether you are preparing for an interview or a written test, referring to my notes can be helpful. All primary topics in Chapters II and III of Robin Hartshorne's [_Algebraic Geometry_](https://www.amazon.com/Algebraic-Geometry-Graduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/0387902449) are contained somewhere.

My solutions to Hartshorne's exercises are attached, whereas I claim no originality of them. Solving these problems was a laborious and painful process, but going through those problems did force me to learn all the technical commutative algebra and many techniques in algebraic geometry. Therefore, I seriously urge you to use these solutions carefully (especially if you have delved into a problem but have not made progress).
