This seminar will be about classical Springer theory with an emphasis on concreteness. In the first-half semester, we concentrate on the construction of Springer representations, as well as an alternative construction via perverse sheaves; we will dedicate the second-half semester to more explicit and combinatorial topics, such as parametrizations of nilpotent orbits in classical types using (generalized) tableaux, and Bala-Carter theory to tackle with exceptional cases and the fundamental groups of nilpotent orbits. While time permitting, the explicit generalized Springer Correspondence due to Lusztig follows at last.
