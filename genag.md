## Algebraic Geometry for the Generals

**Instruction Watch**: <br/> This page mainly covers the algebraic geometry necessary to pass the graduate's general qualifying examinations at BICMR. Whether you are preparing for an interview or a written test, you can refer to the notes I have provided for help. All primary topics that have occured in Chapter II and III of Robin Hartshorne's [_Algebraic Geometry_](https://www.amazon.com/Algebraic-Geometry-Graduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/0387902449) are contained somewhere. My solutions of Hartshorne's exercises are attached as well (whereas I claim no originality of them). Solving these problems was a laborious and somewhat painful process, but going through those problems did force me to learn all the technical commutative algebra, as well as many techniques in algebraic geometry. Therefore, I seriously urge you to be careful about using these solutions; the best way to solve problems is always through one's own thinking.
