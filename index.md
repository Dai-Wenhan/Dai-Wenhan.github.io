## Seminars

### 2022 Spring (ongoing)

- [**Geometry of Shimura varieties mod _p_**](./Sh-var-mod-p.md).

  This seminar will be a mix of learning and research, on the topic of geometry of Shimura varieties mod _p_. We mainly follow some work by David Helm, Yichao Tian, and Liang Xiao. The purpose of this semester-long seminar is to go over basic facts and constructions around the concept of automorphic forms, especially its _p_-adic aspects: eigencurves, overconvergent automorphic forms. Most talks will be given by participants. For each talk, please prepare 90 minutes talk, followed by a 30 minutes exercise/discussion time. Talks will be given in English.
  - **Instructor**: [Liang Xiao](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~lxiao/index.htm).
  - **Time**: Every Monday, 10–noon.
  - **Location**: BICMR 77201.

- [**Locally Analytic _p_-adic Representations**](./loc-an-rep.md).

  The purpose of this semester-long seminar is to go over the theory of continuous and locally analytic representations of _p_-adic groups. The first half will focus on the theory of Schneider-Teitelbaum, following their Hangzhou note. The second half may learn Orlik-Strauch representations and some results of Arkedov.
  - **Instructor**: [Yiwen Ding](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~dingyiwen/).
  - **Time**: Every Tuesday, 10–noon.
