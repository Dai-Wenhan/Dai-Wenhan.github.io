## Locally Analytic _p_-adic Representations.

The purpose of this semester-long seminar is to go over the theory of continuous and locally analytic representations of _p_-adic groups. The first half will focus on the theory of Schneider-Teitelbaum, following their Hangzhou note. The second half may learn Orlik-Strauch representations and some results of Arkedov.
- **Time**: Every Tuesday, 10–noon.
- **Location**: BICMR 77201.
- **Instructor**: [Yiwen Ding](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~dingyiwen/).
