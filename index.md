### Course Notes



### Seminars

#### 2022 Spring (ongoing)

- [**Geometry of Shimura varieties mod _p_**](docs/Sh-var-mod-p.md).

  This seminar will be a mix of learning and research, on the topic of geometry of Shimura varieties mod _p_. We mainly follow some work by David Helm, Yichao Tian, and Liang Xiao. The purpose of this semester-long seminar is to go over basic facts and constructions around the concept of automorphic forms, especially its _p_-adic aspects: eigencurves, overconvergent automorphic forms. Most talks will be given by participants. For each talk, please prepare 90 minutes talk, followed by a 30 minutes exercise/discussion time. Talks will be given in English.
  - **Time**: Every Monday, 10–noon.
  - **Location**: BICMR 77201.
  - **Instructor**: [Liang Xiao](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~lxiao/index.htm).

- **Springer Theory, Representation Theory, and Complex Geometry.**

#### 2021 Fall

- **3264 and All That**
